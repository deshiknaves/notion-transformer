# Notion Transformer

Notion is an incredible platform, and its API provides us with endless possibilities to extend our capabilities on the platform. However, the current API can be verbose and overly reflective of Notion's underlying block structure, making it challenging to work with in some cases. This is where our package comes in - we aim to simplify your experience by transforming the Notion API into a more user-friendly format that is easier to work with in a variety of situations. Whether you're looking to customize your use of Notion or simply looking for a more streamlined approach, our package can help you achieve your goals with ease.

This is the core package that provides a transformation pipeline which can take transformers to produce the output. This is utilized in `@notion-transformer/markdown` and `@notion-transformer/json`.
